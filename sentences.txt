How successful people think

Introduction
Good thinkers are always in demand.
A person who knows how may always have a job, but the person whon knows why will always be his boss.
Good thinkers solove problems, they never lack ideas that can build an organization, and they always have hope for a better future.
Good thinkers rarely find themselves at the mercy of ruthless people who would take advantage of them or try to deceive them, people like Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who once boasted, "What luck for rulers that men do not think"
Those who develop the process of good thinking can rule themselves-even while under an oppressive ruler or in other difficult circumstances.
In short, good thinkers are successful.
I've studied successful people for forty years, and though the diversity you find among them is astounding, I've found that they are all alike in one way: how they think!
That is the one thing that sparates successufl people from unsuccessful ones.
And here'sthe good news.
How successful people think can be learned.
If you change your thinking, you can change your life!

WHY YOU SHOULD CHANGE YOUR THINKING
It's hard to overstate the value of changing your thinking.
Good thinking can do many things for you: generate revenue, solve problems, and create opportunites.
It can take you to a whole new level-personally and professionally.
It really can change your life.
Consider some things you need to know about changing your thinking:

1. Changed Thinking Is Not Automatic
Sadly, a change in thinking doesn't happen on its own.
Good ideas rarely go out and find someone.
If you want to find a good idea, you mush search for it.
If you want to become a better thinker, you need to work at it-and once you begin to become a better tthinker, the good ideas keep coming.
In fact, the amount of good thinking you can do at any time depends primarily on the amount of good thinking you are already doing.

2. Changed Thinking Is Difficult
When you hear someone say, "Now this is just off the top of my head," expect dandruff.
The only people who believe thinking is easy are those Einstein, one of the best thinkers who ever lived, asserted, Thinking is
hard work; that’s why so few do it.” Because thinking is so difficult, you
want to use anything you can to help you improve the process.

3. Changed Thinking Is Worth the Investment
Author Napoleon Hill observed, “More gold has been mined from the
thoughts of man than has ever been taken from the earth.”
When you take
the time to learn how to change your thinking and become a better thinker,
you are investing in yourself. 
Gold mines tap out. Stock markets crash. Real
estate investments can go sour.
 But a human mind with the ability to think
well is like a diamond mine that never runs out. It’s priceless.
