How successful people think

Introduction
Good thinkers are always in demand.
A person who knows how may always have a job, but the person whon knows why will always be his boss.
Good thinkers solove problems, they never lack ideas that can build an organization, and they always have hope for a better future.
Good thinkers rarely find themselves at the mercy of ruthless people who would take advantage of them or try to deceive them, people like Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who once boasted, "What luck for rulers that men do not think"
Those who develop the process of good thinking can rule themselves-even while under an oppressive ruler or in other difficult circumstances.
In short, good thinkers are successful.
I've studied successful people for forty years, and though the diversity you find among them is astounding, I've found that they are all alike in one way: how they think!
That is the one thing that sparates successufl people from unsuccessful ones.
And here'sthe good news.
How successful people think can be learned.
If you change your thinking, you can change your life!
